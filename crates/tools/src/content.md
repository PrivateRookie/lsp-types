# Language Server Protocol 

This document describes version 2.0 - 2.1 of the language server protocol. Changes are marked with a change or new bar on the left hand side. Below is a summary of the major changes compared to version 1.0:

- Consistent use of properties on request param objects. These properties are now structured like parameters in API's. So for example if an API takes a text document as the first parameter the corresponding parameter literal in the JSON RPC protocol now has a property `textDocument`. 
- Consistent support for language identifiers. This means that the language ID is passed to the server via the open notification. Further references to the text document don't transfer this information anymore.
- Support for version numbers on documents. The initial version number is sent to the server via the open notification. Document change notification do carry information about version numbers as well.
- Support for request cancellation.
- Interface naming: using consistent names without `I` prefix.

The 1.x version of this document can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/versions/protocol-1-x.md).

## Base Protocol

The base protocol consists of a header and a content part (comparable to HTTP). The header and content part are
separated by a '\r\n'.

### Header Part

The header part consists of header fields. Each header field is comprised of a name and a value,
separated by ': ' (a colon and a space).
Each header field is terminated by '\r\n'. 
Considering the last header field and the overall header itself are each terminated with '\r\n',
and that at least one header is mandatory, this means that two '\r\n' sequences always 
immediately precede the content part of a message.

Currently the following header fields are supported:

| Header Field Name | Value Type  | Description |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------|
| Content-Length    | number      | The length of the content part in bytes. This header is required. |
| Content-Type      | string      | The mime type of the content part. Defaults to application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf8 |

The header part is encoded using the 'ascii' encoding. This includes the '\r\n' separating the header and content part.

### Content Part

Contains the actual content of the message. The content part of a message uses [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/) to describe requests, responses and notifications. The content part is encoded using the charset provided in the Content-Type field. It defaults to 'utf8', which is the only encoding supported right now. 


### Example:

```
Content-Length: ...\r\n
\r\n
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"method": "textDocument/didOpen", 
	"params": {
		...
	}
}
```
### Base Protocol JSON structures

The following TypeScript definitions describe the base [JSON-RPC protocol](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):

#### Abstract Message

A general message as defined by JSON-RPC. The language server protocol always uses "2.0" as the jsonrpc version.

```typescript
interface Message {
	jsonrpc: string;
}
```
#### RequestMessage 

A request message to describe a request between the client and the server. Every processed request must send a response back to the sender of the request.

```typescript
interface RequestMessage extends Message {

	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: number | string;

	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The method's params.
	 */
	params?: any
}
```

#### Response Message

Response Message sent as a result of a request.

```typescript
interface ResponseMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: number | string;

	/**
	 * The result of a request. This can be omitted in
	 * the case of an error.
	 */
	result?: any;

	/**
	 * The error object in case a request fails.
	 */
	error?: ResponseError<any>;
}

interface ResponseError<D> {
	/**
	 * A number indicating the error type that occurred.
	 */
	code: number;

	/**
	 * A string providing a short description of the error.
	 */
	message: string;

	/**
	 * A Primitive or Structured value that contains additional
	 * information about the error. Can be omitted.
	 */
	data?: D;
}

export namespace ErrorCodes {
	export const ParseError: number = -32700;
	export const InvalidRequest: number = -32600;
	export const MethodNotFound: number = -32601;
	export const InvalidParams: number = -32602;
	export const InternalError: number = -32603;
	export const serverErrorStart: number = -32099;
	export const serverErrorEnd: number = -32000;
}
```
#### Notification Message

A notification message. A processed notification message must not send a response back. They work like events.

```typescript
interface NotificationMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The notification's params.
	 */
	params?: any
}
```

#### <a name="cancelRequest"></a> Cancellation Support

>**New:** The base protocol now offers support for request cancellation. To cancel a request, a notification message with the following properties is sent:
 
_Notification_:
* method: '$/cancelRequest'
* params: `CancelParams` defined as follows:
```typescript
interface CancelParams {
	/**
	 * The request id to cancel.
	 */
	id: number | string;
}
```

A request that got canceled still needs to return from the server and send a response back. It can not be left open / hanging. This is in line with the JSON RPC protocol that requires that every request sends a response back. In addition it allows for returning partial results on cancel.

## Language Server Protocol

The language server protocol defines a set of JSON-RPC request, response and notification messages which are exchanged using the above base protocol. This section starts describing the basic JSON structures used in the protocol. The document uses TypeScript interfaces to describe these. Based on the basic JSON structures, the actual requests with their responses and the notifications are described.

The protocol currently assumes that one server serves one tool. There is currently no support in the protocol to share one server between different tools. Such a sharing would require additional protocol to either lock a document to support concurrent editing.

### Basic JSON Structures

#### URI

URI's are transferred as strings. The URI's format is defined in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)

```
  foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
  \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
   |           |            |            |        |
scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
   |   _____________________|__
  / \ /                        \
  urn:example:animal:ferret:nose
```

We also maintain a node module to parse a string into `scheme`, `authority`, `path`, `query`, and `fragment` URI components. The GitHub repository is [https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-uri) the npm module is [https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-uri](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-uri).


#### Position

Position in a text document expressed as zero-based line and character offset. A position is between two characters like an 'insert' cursor in a editor.

```typescript
interface Position {
	/**
	 * Line position in a document (zero-based).
	 */
	line: number;

	/**
	 * Character offset on a line in a document (zero-based).
	 */
	character: number;
}
```
#### Range

A range in a text document expressed as (zero-based) start and end positions. A range is comparable to a selection in an editor. Therefore the end position is exclusive.

```typescript
interface Range {
	/**
	 * The range's start position.
	 */
	start: Position;

	/**
	 * The range's end position.
	 */
	end: Position;
}
```

#### Location

Represents a location inside a resource, such as a line inside a text file.
```typescript
interface Location {
	uri: string;
	range: Range;
}
```

#### Diagnostic

Represents a diagnostic, such as a compiler error or warning. Diagnostic objects are only valid in the scope of a resource.

```typescript
interface Diagnostic {
	/**
	 * The range at which the message applies.
	 */
	range: Range;

	/**
	 * The diagnostic's severity. Can be omitted. If omitted it is up to the
	 * client to interpret diagnostics as error, warning, info or hint.
	 */
	severity?: number;

	/**
	 * The diagnostic's code. Can be omitted.
	 */
	code?: number | string;

	/**
	 * A human-readable string describing the source of this
	 * diagnostic, e.g. 'typescript' or 'super lint'.
	 */
	source?: string;

	/**
	 * The diagnostic's message.
	 */
	message: string;
}
```

The protocol currently supports the following diagnostic severities:

```typescript
enum DiagnosticSeverity {
	/**
	 * Reports an error.
	 */
	Error = 1,
	/**
	 * Reports a warning.
	 */
	Warning = 2,
	/**
	 * Reports an information.
	 */
	Information = 3,
	/**
	 * Reports a hint.
	 */
	Hint = 4
}
```

#### Command

Represents a reference to a command. Provides a title which will be used to represent a command in the UI. Commands are identified using a string identifier and the protocol currently doesn't specify a set of well known commands. So executing a command requires some tool extension code.

```typescript
interface Command {
	/**
	 * Title of the command, like `save`.
	 */
	title: string;
	/**
	 * The identifier of the actual command handler.
	 */
	command: string;
	/**
	 * Arguments that the command handler should be
	 * invoked with.
	 */
	arguments?: any[];
}
```

#### TextEdit

A textual edit applicable to a text document.

```typescript
interface TextEdit {
	/**
	 * The range of the text document to be manipulated. To insert
	 * text into a document create a range where start === end.
	 */
	range: Range;

	/**
	 * The string to be inserted. For delete operations use an
	 * empty string.
	 */
	newText: string;
}
```

#### TextEdit[]

Complex text manipulations are described with an array of `TextEdit`'s, representing a single change to the document.

All text edits ranges refer to positions in the original document. Text edits ranges must never overlap, that means no part of the original document must be manipulated by more than one edit. However, it is possible that multiple edits have the same start position: multiple inserts, or any number of inserts followed by a single remove or replace edit. If multiple inserts have the same position, the order in the array defines the order in which the inserted strings appear in the resulting text.


#### WorkspaceEdit

A workspace edit represents changes to many resources managed in the workspace.

 ```typescript
interface WorkspaceEdit {
	/**
	 * Holds changes to existing resources.
	 */
	changes: { [uri: string]: TextEdit[]; };
}
```

#### TextDocumentIdentifier

Text documents are identified using a URI. On the protocol level, URIs are passed as strings. The corresponding JSON structure looks like this:
```typescript
interface TextDocumentIdentifier {
	/**
	 * The text document's URI.
	 */
	uri: string;
}
```

#### TextDocumentItem

>**New:** An item to transfer a text document from the client to the server.

```typescript
interface TextDocumentItem {
	/**
	 * The text document's URI.
	 */
	uri: string;

	/**
	 * The text document's language identifier.
	 */
	languageId: string;

	/**
	 * The version number of this document (it will strictly increase after each
	 * change, including undo/redo).
	 */
	version: number;

	/**
	 * The content of the opened text document.
	 */
	text: string;
}
```

#### VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier

>**New:** An identifier to denote a specific version of a text document.

```typescript
interface VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier extends TextDocumentIdentifier {
	/**
	 * The version number of this document.
	 */
	version: number;
}
```

#### TextDocumentPositionParams

>**Changed:** Was `TextDocumentPosition` in 1.0 with inlined parameters

A parameter literal used in requests to pass a text document and a position inside that document.

```typescript
interface TextDocumentPositionParams {
	/**
	 * The text document.
	 */
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;

	/**
	 * The position inside the text document.
	 */
	position: Position;
}
```

### Actual Protocol

This section documents the actual language server protocol. It uses the following format:

* a header describing the request
* a _Request_ section describing the format of the request sent. The method is a string identifying the request the params are documented using a TypeScript interface
* a _Response_ section describing the format of the response. The result item describes the returned data in case of a success. The error.data describes the returned data in case of an error. Please remember that in case of a failure the response already contains an error.code and an error.message field. These fields are only specified if the protocol forces the use of certain error codes or messages. In cases where the server can decide on these values freely they aren't listed here.

#### <a name="initialize"></a>Initialize Request

The initialize request is sent as the first request from the client to the server. If the server receives request or notification before the `initialize` request it should act as follows:

* for a request the respond should be errored with `code: -32001`. The message can be picked by the server. 
* notifications should be dropped.

_Request_
* method: 'initialize'
* params: `InitializeParams` defined as follows:
```typescript
interface InitializeParams {
	/**
	 * The process Id of the parent process that started
	 * the server. Is null if the process has not been started by another process.
	 * If the parent process is not alive then the server should exit (see exit notification) its process.
	 */
	processId?: number;

	/**
	 * The rootPath of the workspace. Is null
	 * if no folder is open.
	 */
	rootPath?: string;

	/**
	 * User provided initialization options.
	 */
	initializationOptions?: any;

	/**
	 * The capabilities provided by the client (editor)
	 */
	capabilities: ClientCapabilities;
}
```
Where `ClientCapabilities` are currently empty:
```typescript
interface ClientCapabilities {
}
```

_Response_
* result: `InitializeResult` defined as follows:
```typescript
interface InitializeResult {
	/**
	 * The capabilities the language server provides.
	 */
	capabilities: ServerCapabilities;
}
```
* error.data:
```typescript
interface InitializeError {
	/**
	 * Indicates whether the client should retry to send the
	 * initialize request after showing the message provided
	 * in the ResponseError.
	 */
	retry: boolean;
}
```
The server can signal the following capabilities:
```typescript
/**
 * Defines how the host (editor) should sync document changes to the language server.
 */
enum TextDocumentSyncKind {
	/**
	 * Documents should not be synced at all.
	 */
	None = 0,
	/**
	 * Documents are synced by always sending the full content of the document.
	 */
	Full = 1,
	/**
	 * Documents are synced by sending the full content on open. After that only incremental 
	 * updates to the document are sent.
	 */
	Incremental = 2
}
```
```typescript
/**
 * Completion options.
 */
interface CompletionOptions {
	/**
	 * The server provides support to resolve additional information for a completion item.
	 */
	resolveProvider?: boolean;

	/**
	 * The characters that trigger completion automatically.
	 */
	triggerCharacters?: string[];
}
```
```typescript
/**
 * Signature help options.
 */
interface SignatureHelpOptions {
	/**
	 * The characters that trigger signature help automatically.
	 */
	triggerCharacters?: string[];
}
```
```typescript
/**
 * Code Lens options.
 */
interface CodeLensOptions {
	/**
	 * Code lens has a resolve provider as well.
	 */
	resolveProvider?: boolean;
}
```
```typescript
/**
 * Format document on type options
 */
interface DocumentOnTypeFormattingOptions {
	/**
	 * A character on which formatting should be triggered, like `}`.
	 */
	firstTriggerCharacter: string;
	/**
	 * More trigger characters.
	 */
	moreTriggerCharacter?: string[]
}
```
```typescript
interface ServerCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Defines how text documents are synced.
	 */
	textDocumentSync?: number;
	/**
	 * The server provides hover support.
	 */
	hoverProvider?: boolean;
	/**
	 * The server provides completion support.
	 */
	completionProvider?: CompletionOptions;

	/**
	 * The server provides document formatting on typing.
	 */
	documentOnTypeFormattingProvider?: DocumentOnTypeFormattingOptions;
	/**
	 * The server provides rename support.
	 */
	renameProvider?: boolean
}
```

#### <a name="shutdown"></a>Shutdown Request

#### <a name="workspace_didChangeWatchedFiles"></a>DidChangeWatchedFiles Notification

The watched files notification is sent from the client to the server when the client detects changes to files watched by the language client.

_Notification_:
* method: 'workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles'
* params: `DidChangeWatchedFilesParams` defined as follows:
```typescript
interface DidChangeWatchedFilesParams {
	/**
	 * The actual file events.
	 */
	changes: FileEvent[];
}
```
Where FileEvents are described as follows:
```typescript
/**
 * The file event type.
 */
enum FileChangeType {
	/**
	 * The file got created.
	 */
	Created = 1,
	/**
	 * The file got changed.
	 */
	Changed = 2,
	/**
	 * The file got deleted.
	 */
	Deleted = 3
}
```
```typescript
/**
 * An event describing a file change.
 */
interface FileEvent {
	/**
	 * The file's URI.
	 */
	uri: string;
	/**
	 * The change type.
	 */
	type: number;
}
```

#### <a name="textDocument_publishDiagnostics"></a>PublishDiagnostics Notification

Diagnostics notification are sent from the server to the client to signal results of validation runs.

_Notification_
* method: 'textDocument/publishDiagnostics'
* params: `PublishDiagnosticsParams` defined as follows:
```typescript
interface PublishDiagnosticsParams {
	/**
	 * The URI for which diagnostic information is reported.
	 */
	uri: string;

	/**
	 * An array of diagnostic information items.
	 */
	diagnostics: Diagnostic[];
}
```

#### <a name="textDocument_completion"></a>Completion Request

The Completion request is sent from the client to the server to compute completion items at a given cursor position. Completion items are presented in the [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_intellisense) user interface. If computing full completion items is expensive, servers can additionally provide a handler for the completion item resolve request ('completionItem/resolve'). This request is sent when a completion item is selected in the user interface. A typically use case is for example: the 'textDocument/completion' request doesn't fill in the `documentation` property for returned completion items since it is expensive to compute. When the item is selected in the user interface then a 'completionItem/resolve' request is sent with the selected completion item as a param. The returned completion item should have the documentation property filled in.

>**Changed:** In 2.0 the request uses `TextDocumentPositionParams` with a proper `textDocument` and `position` property. In 1.0 the uri of the referenced text document was inlined into the params object.
